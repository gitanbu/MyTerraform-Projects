Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a procedure that actively investigates running applications with penetration tests to detect possible security vulnerabilities,such as SQL injection and cross-­site scripting

DAST tools continually search for vulnerabilities in a web application that is in production, hunting for weaknesses that attackers could try to exploit,

SAST, or Static Application Security Testing, also known as “white box testing” has been around for more than a decade. It allows developers to find security vulnerabilities in the application source code earlier in the software development life cycle.
